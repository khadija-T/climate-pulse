# Climate Pulse

Welcome to **Climate Pulse**, a Next.js-based web application that provides real-time weather and air quality information for various locations worldwide. This project utilizes dynamic routing, API routes, and a location switcher to deliver an interactive user experience.

## Overview

Climate Pulse displays current weather conditions, temperature, air quality index, and other environmental data for selected locations. The layout features a visually appealing design with a background image, a 2x2 grid of cards, and a location switcher (accessible via the link icon beside the region name). The project is built with Next.js, leveraging its App Router for dynamic routing and server-side rendering.

- **Region**: Displays the current region (e.g., North America) and city (e.g., New York City).
- **Cards**: Show details such as Current Weather (e.g., overcast clouds), Current Temperature (e.g., 23.59Â°C), and Air Pollution & Quality (e.g., Air Quality Index, pollutant levels).
- **Location Switcher**: Allows users to select from a list of locations to view data for different cities.

## Features

- **Dynamic Routing**: Navigate to specific location pages using Next.js dynamic routes.
- **API Routes**: Fetch and serve location-based data through custom API endpoints.
- **Location Switcher**: Interactive list to switch between locations, integrated with the UI.
- **Real-Time Data**: Displays current weather and air quality metrics (mocked or from an API).
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized layout with a background image and card-based information display.
